# finchat

This project is to create a small site that can collect user data and provide answers to the questions asked.
it's a bundle of html, css and python, prepared using the Django framework.
It contains a couple of page: a welcome, sign up, register and question asking pages.

it's integrated with openai.
It's already hosted and running on a hosting platform with some modifications made before hosting.
I will be making some additions soon.
